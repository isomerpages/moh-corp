<p>Ministry of Health (MOH) is an innovative, people-centred organisation, committed to:</p><ul><li><p>medical excellence</p></li><li><p>the promotion of good health</p></li><li><p>the reduction of illness</p></li><li><p>access to good and affordable healthcare for all Singaporeans, appropriate to their needs.</p></li></ul><p>Through MOH, the Government manages the public healthcare system to ensure that good and affordable basic medical services are available to all Singaporeans. We achieve this by providing subsidised medical services while promoting individual responsibility for the costs of healthcare services.</p><p>While our population is encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle and take responsibility for their own health, safety nets are in place to ensure that no Singaporean is denied access to healthcare or turned away by public hospitals because of lack of money.</p><p>The public healthcare delivery system is geographically structured as vertically integrated delivery networks: National University Health System (NUHS), National Healthcare Group (NHG) and Singapore Health Services (SHS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The work of MOH is implemented through its three main groups:</p><ul><li><p>Policy and Corporate Group</p></li><li><p>Operational Groups</p></li><li><p>Professional Cluster</p></li></ul><p>MOH also licenses and regulates all healthcare establishments such as hospitals, nursing homes, clinical laboratories, medical and dental clinics.&nbsp;</p>
