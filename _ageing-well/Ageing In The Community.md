<p>Active aging is about enjoying a better and longer quality of life! It
goes beyond staying healthy. It's also about you staying engaged and enjoying
every aspect of life; physically, socially, or mentally.</p>
<p>Having an active ageing mindset means finding ways for yourself to participate
in activities, stay connected with others, make the most of each day.</p>
<p>Staying active not only boosts your well-being but also helps maintain
your independence and sense of purpose. It helps you stay strong, bounce
back from challenges, and stay connected to the things you enjoy and love.</p>
