<p>Active aging is about enjoying a better and longer quality of life! It
goes beyond staying healthy. It's also about you staying engaged and enjoying
every aspect of life; physically, socially, or mentally.</p>
<p>Having an active ageing mindset means finding ways for yourself to participate
in activities, stay connected with others, make the most of each day.</p>
<p>Staying active not only boosts your well-being but also helps maintain
your independence and sense of purpose. It helps you stay strong, bounce
back from challenges, and stay connected to the things you enjoy and love.</p>

<p>An Active Ageing Centre (AAC) is a drop-in social recreational centre
that extends support to seniors living nearby in the community. It is a
go-to point for seniors to have the opportunity to build strong social
connections, take part in recreational activities, and contribute to the
community as they wish.</p>
<p>AACs are suitable for all seniors who would like to remain physically,
mentally and socially active, offering a range of activities, programmes,
and services for seniors with varied interests and abilities, such as day
care and community rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Centres also welcome seniors who would like to volunteer at the centre,
such as helping out with centre activities, visiting lonely seniors or
running errands for seniors.</p>
