<h2><strong>Advance Care Planning</strong></h2>
<p>Advance Care Planning (ACP) is a voluntary and non-legally binding process
aimed at planning for future healthcare options. Through thoughtful conversations
with family and doctors, patients explore and express their goals, values,
and beliefs. ACP discussions guide individuals to articulate their preferences
regarding future healthcare treatments.</p>
<p>Additionally, ACP involves the nomination of a "substitute decision-maker"
empowered to make choices on behalf of the patient. The documented discussions
serve as valuable guidance for the medical team when unforeseen crises
arise, and the patient is unable to communicate.</p>
