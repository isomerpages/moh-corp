Through thoughtful conversations with family and doctors, patients explore and express their goals, values, and beliefs. ACP discussions guide individuals to articulate their preferences regarding future healthcare treatments. Additionally, ACP involves the nomination of a "substitute decision-maker" empowered to make choices on behalf of the patient. The documented discussions serve as valuable guidance for the medical team when unforeseen crises arise, and the patient is unable to communicate.</p><h4><strong>MyLegacy</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/mylegacy.png"></div><p>MyLegacy@LifeSG is a trusted government platform for end-of-life planning.
