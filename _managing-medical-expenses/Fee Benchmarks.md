<p>In Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) establishes fee benchmarks
    for healthcare services, like consultations and surgeries, to ensure fair
    and transparent pricing. Although healthcare providers are not obligated
    to follow these benchmarks, doing so is encouraged for transparency. Some
    insurance companies may reimburse providers based on these benchmarks.
    Fee benchmarks play a crucial role in making healthcare accessible and
    affordable by preventing overcharging and ensuring fairness in pricing,
    benefiting patients by avoiding excessive costs.</p>
