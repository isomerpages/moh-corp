<h3><strong>What is MediSave?</strong></h3><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/team_working_together_project.jpg"></div><p>MediSave is a national medical savings scheme that helps individuals set aside part of their income to pay for their personal or approved dependents’ hospitalisation, day surgery and certain outpatient expenses, as well as their healthcare needs in old age.</p><p>MediSave withdrawal limits have been carefully set to ensure that Singaporeans have sufficient savings in their MediSave Account for their basic healthcare needs in old age. The withdrawal limits are generally adequate to cover most of the charges incurred at subsidised inpatient wards and outpatient treatments.</p><h3><strong>What can MediSave be used for?</strong></h3><p><strong>To pay for insurance premiums for MediShield Life, Integrated Shield Plans and ElderShield or CareShield Life</strong></p><p>MediSave can be used to pay for an individual’s own health insurance premiums, or those of their approved dependents.</p><p>MediShield Life and ElderShield or CareShield Life premiums can be covered fully by MediSave.</p><p>MediSave may also be used to pay for Integrated Shield Plan (IPs) and ElderShield Supplement premiums, up to withdrawal limits. Find out more about the Additional Withdrawal Limits for IPs and the withdrawal limit for ElderShield Supplements by <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life" class="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="">using this link</a>.</p><p>MediSave can be used to pay for an individual’s own / approved dependents’ hospitalisation expenses in Singapore.</p><p><strong>Inpatient and Day Surgery at Acute Hospitals</strong></p><p>The total MediSave claimable for a given inpatient or day surgery episode is the sum of the daily hospital charge limit and the surgical limit.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Daily Hospital Limit</strong></p></li></ul><p>The inpatient daily hospital limit applies if the patient is admitted to the hospital for at least 8 hours, while the day surgery limit applies if a patient undergoes a surgical operation listed under the Table of Surgical Procedures and is admitted and discharged within the same day.
