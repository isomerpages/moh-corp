<p>MediShield Life is a basic health insurance plan, administered by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, which helps to pay for large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, such as dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer. It is structured so that patients pay less MediSave/cash for large hospital bills.</p><h4><strong>Who Is Eligible?</strong></h4><p>All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, including the very old and those who have pre-existing conditions.<br><br><a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/home/our-healthcare-system/medishield-life/what-is-medishield-life/medishield-life" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Please click here</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p><h4><strong>What Are The Benefits?</strong></h4><p>MediShield Life is sized for subsidised treatment in public hospitals and pegged at B2/C-type wards. If you choose to stay in an A/B1-type ward or in a&nbsp;private hospital, you are still covered by MediShield Life. However, you will find that your MediShield Life payout will cover only a small proportion of your bill. You would need to draw from MediSave and/or cash to pay the balance.<br><br><a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/home/our-healthcare-system/medishield-life/what-is-medishield-life/how-to-make-a-medishield-life-claim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Please click here</a>&nbsp;for more information on how to make a MediShield Life Claim.<br><br><a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/home/our-healthcare-system/medishield-life/what-is-medishield-life/what-medishield-life-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Please click here</a>&nbsp;to read more on MediShield Life Benefits.</p><p></p>
